# essay-template-generator
I spent a night and a half making an app to build a 3,000 word essay template because I didn't want to manually copy and paste a sample paragraph 30 times.

Even worse, I wrote 50 LINES OF CODE only to realize all I needed were three lines.

This is very brute force so it's not pretty but it works!
